# taiwan_dada2
Here we'll give dada2 a swing, see if we repeat our results from the 2016 uparse pipeline of the taiwan reads. 

A preprint of this analysis using uparse is available at:
https://doi.org/10.1101/184960 (bioninformatics)
https://doi.org/10.1101/210641 (ecological analysis)

But in answer to some reviewer concerns I am rerunning the ecological analysis. First, however, I'd like to rebuild my community matrices, 
which were lost when my computer was stolen. I thought I'd use the chance to learn about dada2 and see if my 
initial results using uparse are largely repeated here.
