## removing primers from wood reads? Or are they already gone?

## unzip wood reads
for i in *
do 
gunzip $i
done

## look:
head lane1-s160-index-AAGCACTG-GTGATCCANNNN-Dc-X_S160_L001_R1_001.fastq

## general ITS1f:
grep CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA lane1-s160-index-AAGCACTG-GTGATCCANNNN-Dc-X_S160_L001_R1_001.fastq

grep CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA lane1-s160-index-AAGCACTG-GTGATCCANNNN-Dc-X_S160_L001_R2_001.fastq
## nope

## all files:
grep CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA -R ./ | wc -l  ## 129 

grep ^CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA -R ./  ## just one?
grep ^CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA -R ./ | wc -l  ## yup

## reverse compliment of ITS1f?
grep CTTCCTCTAAATGACCAAG -R ./  ## all R2, by the looks

grep CTTCCTCTAAATGACCAAG -R ./ > wtf.txt &  

grep CTTCCTCTAAATGACCAAG -R ./ | wc -l ## 2,370,829 eh? 

grep ^CTTCCTCTAAATGACCAAG -R ./ | wc -l

## how many reads do I have in total?
grep ^@M0 -R ./ | wc -l ## 11135598, /2 = ~5.56 x 10^6
## so I guess nearly half of these reads have the reverse compliment on them, near the end of their sequence. 

## should I get rid of this? Seems like best to clip it off...




## general ITS2:
grep GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC lane1-s160-index-AAGCACTG-GTGATCCANNNN-Dc-X_S160_L001_R1_001.fastq
grep GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC lane1-s160-index-AAGCACTG-GTGATCCANNNN-Dc-X_S160_L001_R2_001.fastq
## nope

## all files:
grep GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC -R ./ | wc -l  ## 57, R1 and R2

grep ^GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC -R ./  ##
grep ^GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC -R ./ | wc -l  ##


## get back to these, will remove the floating primer reads later

## reverse compliment of ITS2?
grep GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC -R ./ 

grep ^GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC -R ./  | wc -l ## 213 weird, some amount of these start with ITS 2, reverse compliment

grep GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC -R ./ | wc -l  ## 2,802,824. As above 

grep GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC -R ./ > wtf2.txt &

grep R1 wtf2.txt | wc -l ## 2803811 around half, again

grep R2 wtf2.txt | wc -l ## 13. A few.


## so I think the story here is that the R1 are my forward reads.
## They contain the reverse compliment of the other primer, near
## their ends.

## The same is true for the R2, which must be my reverse reads

## so plan to clean up:

## 1) clip off the ends, reverse primer on. 
## 2) remove any remaining reads with either primer
## or the RC of either primer anywhere in the 
## in the sequence.  
## 3) also remove the matched read from the other 
## other direction 

## but first, let's get Roo's demultiplexed, and see if there 
## are similar issues ....

################################################

## demult Roo's reads

## can we use the fastx barcode splitter to demultiplex?
## I remember he used split barcodes, golay...

## what do his reads look like?

cd /home/daniel/Documents/taiwan/leafreads

head -n 8 TaiwanFA_R2.fastq

## what are we looking at here? 

ITS1f=CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA

head -n 8 TaiwanFA_R2.fastq | grep $ITS1f ## lotsa floating primers but no anchored primer. Golays must go first
## 159 floaters
## 18 million reads total?

grep $ITS1f TaiwanFA_R1.fastq | wc -l && wc -l TaiwanFA_R1.fastq

## half of one set of barcodes

## so for instance, our first barcode is:
## ACCCATATATCC
## the first half of this should be abundant as the first six BP of many of the reads:

head -n 1000000 TaiwanFA_R2.fastq | grep ^ACCCAT 

head -n 1000000 TaiwanFA_R2.fastq | grep ^ACCCAT | wc -l ## 12,267 reads
## yeah, that works. 

## the other half should be abundant as the start of many of the R1 reads:

head -n 1000000 TaiwanFA_R1.fastq | grep ^ATATCC
head -n 1000000 TaiwanFA_R1.fastq | grep ^ATATCC | wc -l ## 13,156 reads

## how do we know we have the same read order for forward and reverse?

head -n 4 TaiwanFA_R1.fastq
head -n 4 TaiwanFA_R2.fastq

head -n 24 TaiwanFA_R1.fastq | sed -n '1~4p' 
head -n 24 TaiwanFA_R2.fastq | sed -n '1~4p' 

tail -n 24 TaiwanFA_R1.fastq | sed -n '1~4p' 
tail -n 24 TaiwanFA_R2.fastq | sed -n '1~4p' 

## they seem to be ordered correctly. 

## let's try my old script:

cd /home/daniel/Documents/taiwan/taiwan_dada2
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchurch/taiwan_combined_biom/master/scripts/BCunsplit4.py
mv BCunsplit4.py BCunsplit.py
chmod 775 BCunsplit.py

## make toy files:
head -n 1000 ../leafreads/TaiwanFA_R1.fastq > toy_R1.fastq
head toy_R1.fastq

head -n 1000 ../leafreads/TaiwanFA_R2.fastq > toy_R2.fastq
head toy_R2.fastq

## I think that the old script removed the primers entirely from
## the reverse reads, and relied on the exact matching of order
## to keep things organized. But I think here we need both the 
## reverse and forward reads to keep a copy of their barcodes, 
## since demultiplexing occurs prior to merging, using these
## barcodes.

## so edits made. Try it out:

./BCunsplit.py toy_R2.fastq toy_R1.fastq

## look at the results:

## take the first six BP of the first 10 reads from each, 
## check to see if they are the same
aa=$(head -n 40 rearranged_toy_R2.fastq | sed -n '2~4p' | cut -c -6)
bb=$(head -n 40 toy_R2.fastq | sed -n '2~4p' | cut -c -6)
echo $aa
echo $bb
if [ "$aa" == "$bb" ]; then echo "true"; fi

## and the original?

cc=$(head -n 40 ../leafreads/TaiwanFA_R2.fastq | sed -n '2~4p' | cut -c -6)
echo $aa
echo $cc
if [ "$aa" == "$cc" ]; then echo "true"; fi

## all the way?:

aa=$(tail -n 40 rearranged_toy_R2.fastq | sed -n '2~4p' | cut -c -6)
bb=$(tail -n 40 toy_R2.fastq | sed -n '2~4p' | cut -c -6)
echo $aa
echo $bb
if [ "$aa" == "$bb" ]; then echo "true"; fi

## looks good

## now barcodes of the forward and reverse rearranged files should match, too:
aa=$(head -n 40 rearranged_toy_R1.fastq | sed -n '2~4p' | cut -c -12)
bb=$(head -n 40 rearranged_toy_R2.fastq | sed -n '2~4p' | cut -c -12)
echo $aa
echo $bb
if [ "$aa" == "$bb" ]; then echo "true"; fi

aa=$(tail -n 40 rearranged_toy_R1.fastq | sed -n '2~4p' | cut -c -12)
bb=$(tail -n 40 rearranged_toy_R2.fastq | sed -n '2~4p' | cut -c -12)
echo $aa
echo $bb
if [ "$aa" == "$bb" ]; then echo "true"; fi

## looks good to me

## let's do it on the whole data set:

time ./BCunsplit.py ../leafreads/TaiwanFA_R2.fastq ../leafreads/TaiwanFA_R1.fastq

## okay, way too big for my little script - not sure why. I thought 
## using the iterators in python kept the memory use down, even with
## large files

## so either I tinker more with the script or I break up the file 
## into a smaller size. 

## since I don't know how to scale up the script right now, let's try 
## breaking up the file

## how?

## how many lines in Roo's reads? 

leafR1=/home/daniel/Documents/taiwan/leafreads/TaiwanFA_R1.fastq
leafR2=/home/daniel/Documents/taiwan/leafreads/TaiwanFA_R2.fastq

wc -l $leafR1 && wc -l $leafR2

## 73 x 10^6 lines. As long as we split by multiples of four, we should
## be able to maintain our read order. Try files of 10 x 10^6 reads

split -d -l 10000000 $leafR1 leafR1sub

split -d -l 10000000 $leafR2 leafR2sub

## scoured the files with head/tail, they seem to have preserved order
## and kept the individual reads with their quality scores and headers
## intact. 

## so now what? run our barcode rearrangement script on them, concatenate.

## what does this look like?

time ../BCunsplit.py leafR2sub00 leafR1sub00

## yeah works. So let's try:

nus=(00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07)
for i in ${nus[*]}
do 
../BCunsplit.py leafR2sub$i leafR1sub$i
done

## now concatenate:
ls leafR1sub0*

ls leafR2sub0*

cat rearranged_leafR1sub0* > rearranged_leafR1.fastq && cat rearranged_leafR2sub0* > rearranged_leafR2.fastq &

## did this work? line order maintained? Random line checks

grep ACCCATATATCC rearranged_leafR1.fastq | wc -l ## 15
grep ACCCATATATCC $leafR1 | wc -l ## 15

head -n 4 $leafR1

## huh, not seeing the barcode. 

## do the forward and reverse rearranged barcodes match, at least? 
aa=$(head -n 40 rearranged_leafR1.fastq | sed -n '2~4p' | cut -c -12)
bb=$(head -n 40 rearranged_leafR2.fastq | sed -n '2~4p' | cut -c -12)

echo $aa
echo $bb
if [ "$aa" == "$bb" ]; then echo "true"; fi

## yeah, but these aren't barcodes. 
## where are the barcodes?
## and where are the primers? Am I going crazy here?

ITS1f=CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA
ITS1fRC=TTACTTCCTCTAAATGACCAAG
ITS2=GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC
ITS2RC=GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC

head $leafR2 | grep G

head $leafR2 | grep $ITS1f
head $leafR2 | grep $ITS1fRC
head $leafR2 | grep $ITS2
head $leafR2 | grep $ITS2RC

head -n 4000 $leafR2 | grep $ITS1f
head -n 4000 $leafR2 | grep $ITS1fRC
head -n 4000 $leafR2 | grep $ITS2
head -n 4000 $leafR2 | grep $ITS2RC

head -n 4000 $leafR2 | grep ${ITS1f::5} | wc -l 

## nearly all, first five of primer (905 out of 1000 reads)
## the first six must be the first half of the BC
## primer sequences must be in bad shape

head -n 4000 $leafR2 | grep ^${ITS1f::5} | wc -l ## only 1. So these are not starting with ITS1f, BC first

head -n 4000 $leafR2 | grep ${ITS1f::5}  ## generally after 6 bp, makes sense

## how about with the rearranged reads:

echo $(head -n 4000 rearranged_leafR2.fastq | grep ${ITS1f::5} | wc -l) &

echo $(grep ${ITS1f::5} rearranged_leafR2.fastq | wc -l) &

## ok, 12 bp, so that worked...
## but are these actually barcodes?

## check one barcode:
grep GGGCGCGGGGCG $leafR2 | wc -l ## 1105 - 1000 reads, possible, but that's not many...

## how many are where they are supposed to be?
aa=$(grep ^GGGCGCGGGGCG $leafR2 | wc -l) && echo $aa &
## 5. Just five. What the hell.

## check another:
grep ATCAAAAAGACG $leafR2 | wc -l ## 41 ????

aa=$(grep ^ATCAAAAAGACG $leafR2 | wc -l) && echo $aa & ## 0

## hmm, not understanding this...

## are these not the barcodes?

## shall we try demultiplexing with fastx and see what happens?

## first have to make the text file for fastx...

## should be as simple as listing the barcodes from Roo's map,
## with a name in front of each:

head leafread_map.txt

libreoffice --calc leafread_map.txt &

## okay, there's a bunch of carriage returns in Roo's text file,

## can we turn these into unix line breaks?

head -c 500 leafread_map.txt 

## let's try with dos2unix:

dos2unix -c mac -n leafread_map.txt leafread_map2.txt

## now get first two columns

head leafread_map2.txt | cut -f 1-2

cut -f 1-2 leafread_map2.txt > leafread_fastx_map.txt

## now will fastx split up our samples?

mkdir demult 
cd demult 

cat $leafR1 | fastx_barcode_splitter.pl --bcfile ../leafread_fastx_map.txt --prefix leaf_sample_  \
--bol --mismatches 1 --partial 1 

cat $leafR2 | fastx_barcode_splitter.pl --bcfile ../leafread_fastx_map.txt --prefix leaf_sample_  \
--bol --mismatches 1 --partial 1 

## it says labels must be alphanumeric...
## sed this problem?:

sed -i 's/\.1/A/' leafread_fastx_map.txt && sed -i 's/\.2/B/' leafread_fastx_map.txt

## try again...

cat $leafR1 | fastx_barcode_splitter.pl --bcfile ../leafread_fastx_map.txt --prefix leaf_sample_  \
--bol --mismatches 1 --partial 1
